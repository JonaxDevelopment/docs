<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher) or have Python 3.9.0 or higher installed.
  Create a directory first and then continue with the following steps.
</Info>

Step 1. Install the requests package (if on python):
<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
python -m pip install requests
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. In the same directory in which you installed the requests module make the following file (or execute the following command if using curl):

<CodeGroup>
```bash js
fetch('https://api.rectify.international/v1/user/getdiscord/ROBLOXID')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

```bash python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.rectify.international/v1/user/getdiscord/ROBLOXID')

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print(f'Request failed with status code {response.status_code}')
```

```bash curl
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.rectify.international/v1/user/getdiscord/ROBLOXID' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
```
</CodeGroup>


# Response Example

<ResponseField name="Status" type="number">
  Indicates whether the call was successful. 200 if successful, no response if not.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">

Data object containing the user's information.

<Expandable title="Response Info">

<ResponseField name="version" type="string">
  This is the version the API is running on, usually would be PROD(version as an integer).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  This responds whether the request was successful or not. If the user has been verified before and is able to have their info displayed, it is a boolean value.
</ResponseField>
