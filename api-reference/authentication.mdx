## API Tokens

We currently do require apiKey's and you can fetch them by x, and the only requests that require them are the checkApiKey and the userpermissions endpoints as of this time, all other endpoints are free of apiKeys.
apiKey's are generated by administrators for premium owners via a command in the official discord server called /createkey.
